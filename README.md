# SRCF Documentation

This is the Git repository for the SRCF's documentation, available at [docs.srcf.net](https://docs.srcf.net). It is built with Hugo, a static site generator written in Go. You can read, contribute and build these docs yourself, just keep reading!

The previous iteration of our documentation was built with Sphinx, but after facing several shortcomings we decided to move to a static site generator.

## Contributing

All contributions to our documentation are very welcome. We have more detailed information for beginners and advanced users alike on our internal documentation.
