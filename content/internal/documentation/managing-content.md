## Overview

Any contribution to this documentation is welcome. Helping to fix/correct a section is often a good way for newcomers to get around using Git and the terminal.

The below contains instructions for creating or updating content.

## Obtaining the source

You should **first [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/working-with-forks)** our repository into your own GitHub space and make the desired changes there.

Depending on the complexity of your change, you can either:

* use the GitHub web UI (click "edit this file") to make your change. GitHub automatically forks the repository you're trying to edit.
* [clone your forked repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository), edit locally, optionally test your changes, push to your repository and finally make a pull request back to ours

The above process is known as the ["GitHub flow"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/github-flow) and is standard practice across many distributed projects under version control.

If you are creating pages, then you will need to clone the repository locally.

## Changing content

Our docs are written in Markdown, a standard markup format. A quick tutorial is available [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Editing is an important step, and for that you will need a good text editor. VS Code, Atom, Notepad++ are all reliable choices with good extensions to make typing Markdown even easier. For those interested in using the terminal, nano works great for small edits and vim for a full-fledged text editor.

If you just want to fix a typo or add a few sentences, editing text should be sufficient. To do fancier things with Hugo and build upon our docs, you should check out their [documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/). You should also read the additional available pages on these docs.

## Creating a page

Use the standard `hugo new` command to create your page so that the right template (archetype) is used. The template is populated with data like the current date when you create a new page.

To create a tutorial called "How to feed your dog", you would type `hugo new tutorials/animals/how-to-feed-your-dog.md"` into your terminal. The title and file name do not need to match, but it's good to keep things consistent and informative for other contributors.

Ensure that you are in the cloned directory for any commands.

## Commit, push and PR

Now it is time to commit your changes, push them to your repository and make a pull request into our repository. If any of those words are foreign to you, you might want to [visit a Git tutorial](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) or [browse a quick primer](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/).

Before you commit, make sure your message is informative by following [these tips](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). After you've pushed your changes to your local repository, navigating to your repository on GitHub should show a prompt asking you to make a pull request back to upstream (us). If not, then you can [create your own pull request](https://github.com/SRCF/docs/pulls) manually. Be sure to add informative details as to what the nature of your PR is and what issues it solves (if any).

## Updating the sidebar

1. **Add an entry in the sidebar data file**

    * If you are adding a standalone page, just add a `- title: <something>` to the `groups` list.
    * If you are adding a page in a group, add its title under the `pages` list.
    * If you are adding a new group with child pages, add a title for your group and a `pages` list attribute.

2. **Add the `group:` parameter in the page's front matter**

    This must correspond to the urlized group title in the data file.
