Soc-SRCF mailing lists
======================

The SRCF needs to be able to keep in contact with our users at all times
(a requirement imposed upon us). We therefore automatically subscribe
you to Soc-SRCF, Soc-SRCF-users and Soc-SRCF-maintenance shortly after
creating your account. We will also subscribe you to Soc-SRCF-social if
you requested this during the signup process.

These are very low-traffic mailing lists---just a few messages per
year---and we do our best to ensure that the messages sent are relevant
to as many people as possible. We hope that you will not consider this
to be an inconvenience.

How we use these lists
----------------------

### Soc-SRCF

This contains *members* of the SRCF (membership is for life), and
receives messages from the committee about such things as:

-   major society event announcements (e.g. AGMs, garden parties) \--
    usually about three events per year
-   rare but important society administrative information (e.g.
    constitutional amendments) which affect all members

### Soc-SRCF-users

This contains *users* of the SRCF (which only applies whilst you have an
active shell account), and receives messages from the sysadmins which
are important to account holders, for example:

-   urgent messages which require the attention of every SRCF user (e.g.
    security compromises) \-- very infrequent, we hope!
-   rare but important system administrative information (e.g. terms of
    service changes) which affect all users

### Soc-SRCF-maintenance

This is used for announcements about planned and ongoing system
unavailability (downtime), and announcements about important changes to
service provision (e.g. increased quotas, software changes which may
require your action). If you are not interested in receiving such
messages, you are welcome to unsubscribe, but many users find these
announcements useful.

### Soc-SRCF-social

This is a more open mailing list for announcement and discussion of
social events (pub meets, LAN parties, garden parties and so on). Any
SRCF member is welcome to join or leave this list at any time.

### Soc-SRCF-careers

The SRCF has in the past provided career opportunities informally. Join
this new list to keep up to date with any employment opportunities,
internships and news directly from companies we trust.

Unsubscribing from Soc-SRCF and/or -users
-----------------------------------------

Because we must be able to contact everyone with an SRCF account, you
may only unsubscribe from **Soc-SRCF** or **Soc-SRCF-users** if you are
willing to give up your membership of the SRCF and access to its
services. If this is what you want, please [contact the
sysadmins](https://www.srcf.net/contact) saying you want to terminate
your membership.

If you wish to do so, you may give up your shell account (and so cease
to be an SRCF *user*) while remaining a *member* of the SRCF. In this
case, you will be unsubscribed from Soc-SRCF-users, but *not* Soc-SRCF,
and you are still welcome to attend SRCF events. As above, please
contact the sysadmins to arrange this.

Unsubscribing or rejoining -maintenance and/or -social
