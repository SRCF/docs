# Personal vs. group account

All SRCF users, whether they are looking for web hosting for themselves,
or wish to administrate a group account, must first get a personal SRCF
account. It is completely fine if you apply for SRCF membership when all
you really want is to run the website of a society (or other group),
rather than your own.
