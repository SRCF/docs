SRCF membership is for life, but you can also retain access to our
services provided we have a valid contact address for you.

If you're leaving the university and losing your *\@cam.ac.uk* email
address, make sure to update the email address we have on record for you
to something external. You can login to the SRCF control panel and
change your registered email address on your member page. If you use
mail forwarding using a .forward file or via Hades, check that your mail
is routed to a working address too.

The system administrators need to be able to contact you about your
account, and may suspend accounts without warning if they are unable to
reach you.
