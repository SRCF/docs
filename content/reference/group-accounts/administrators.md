Each group account has a list of *admins*: SRCF users who manage the
account and its services. This includes access to the account in the
control panel, permissions to edit files inside
`/societies/<groupname>`, and receiving administrative email sent to
`<groupname>-admins@srcf.net`. This list may also be used by an
account's website to limit page access to current admins.

We recommend that you keep your own handover documentation, covering
what services and software a group account is using.

When a group account admin leaves the University without taking steps to
retain access to their SRCF account, they may be dropped from the list
of admins. A group with no admins is considered *unmaintained*, at which
point some services will be suspended. To maintain continuity of group
accounts, we recommend keeping at least two admins at all times.
