SRCF documentation
==================

Whether you\'re a society webmaster, budding sysadmin or just an
interested browser, these pages should contain all the necessary answers
to help guide you in whatever you wish to make with our services. To see
what we offer you, head on over to our [main
website](https://www.srcf.net) for more information.

Getting help {#get-help}
------------

Should you at any point need help, we offer three different solutions:

1.  this growing collection of documentation
2.  [a live chat support
    service](https://webchat.srcf.net/?channels=support)
3.  email: `support@srcf.net`

**Please do not be afraid to ask for help!** Asking for help is an
essential stage of the learning process. In the first instance, check
the common requests below and see if that helps you. If not, or if you
don\'t know where to start or what to look for, hop in our live support
channel and we\'ll help get you sorted.

The SRCF is run by volunteers who help to maintain its services for
hundreds of societies. Our services are free and therefore we rely on
donations. If you can, please [consider
donating](https://www.srcf.net/donate).

Learning
--------

The SRCF is run by a community of volunteers, all of which are
constantly learning new things as we improve and grow the SRCF. Being a
newcomer to many of the things in this documentation shouldn\'t stop you
from using our systems or one day joining us. We\'ve produced a series
of tutorials and gathered recommended links for you below. **These are
highly recommended if you\'re just getting started with the SRCF or
Linux.**
