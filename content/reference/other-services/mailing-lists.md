We run [Mailman mailing lists](https://lists.srcf.net) for both personal
and group accounts. New lists can be created via the control panel.

The default list administrator for personal accounts is
`<crsid>@srcf.net`. For group accounts the default list administrator is
the group account's admin address `<groupname>-admins@srcf.net`. To
avoid complicating group account handovers, we recommend you keep this
default for group-owned lists, and manage list admins by adding to the
group account admin list. You are free to use the list moderator role to
add additional users for approving postings and subscriptions.

To delete a mailing list, you'll need to [contact the
sysadmins](https://www.srcf.net/contact). Unless asked otherwise, we
will retain the list archives (though the archives must be public for
them to remain accessible).
