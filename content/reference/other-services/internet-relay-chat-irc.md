## Overview

Internet relay chat is a protocol for real-time text messaging between
internet-connected computers. While it is dated in comparison to some
other messaging protocols, it continues to be used regularly by SRCF
members and as the emergency messaging platform of choice, with several
servers located around the world.

We have written a tutorial on getting started with IRC,
[available here]({{< relref "/tutorials/others/connect-to-irc" >}}).

## Important information

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

Much like you will find in other open source and similar communities, we
have a few guidelines that we want to make clear:

1.  There are no technical prerequisites
2.  Anyone can contribute
3.  By students for students

We have a code of conduct to foster the above aims: inclusivity,
collaboration and teamwork (<https://www.srcf.net/code-of-conduct>)

## Channels

- \#welcome --- a place for newcomers to say hello
- \#general --- chat about anything here, we're humans after all :)
- \#society --- questions and topics about the SRCF as a society
- \#support --- tech questions, SRCF-specific or not
- \#hackday --- home of volunteers, future home of interested
    volunteers
- \#ops --- infra-specific discussion, invite only (interested
    sysadmins encouraged to email <sysadmins@srcf.net> to join!)
- \#srcf --- alumni

## Server details

You need to connect your client to
[irc.srcf.net](irc://irc.srcf.net/srcf). If you have a
suitably-configured IRC client then clicking on that link might work, or
if you want to try out IRC without downloading and installing a client
then the SRCF provides an [IRC web interface](https://webchat.srcf.net).

## Setting up a persistent connection

Some people like to leave an IRC client connected to the network even
when they are away from their computer, or have turned it off, so that
people can continue to leave them messages for when they return. There
are two main ways: a bouncer or a tmux/screen instance.

For tmux/screen, a common choice is [irssi](http://www.irssi.org/),
although there are many others.

If you want to use a bouncer, we recommend ZNC.

## Troubleshooting

### Misconfigured client

If you are seeing 'nick \[\~username\@my-irc-client-is-misconfigured\]' then this is because
you are not connecting to irc.srcf.net (as indicated above) but instead
to some other hostname -- perhaps kern, pip, shell or www. This is not
recommended, since if the IRC server moves at a later date those
addresses will no longer work, whereas irc.srcf.net will always be
updated to point at the new location.
