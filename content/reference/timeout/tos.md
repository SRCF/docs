Terms of Service
----------------

As with any other service we offer, use of Timeout is subject to
specific terms of service. Our [general terms of
service](https://www.srcf.net/tos) still apply.

-   There is an expected vulnerability period from 2-3AM on Sundays, as
    is the case for our other services.
-   Timeout is a service we foresee being heavily used. For this reason,
    please do not abuse our system, for example by creating 10 different
    rooms and running them all at the same time. If you want to host a
    large-scale event, email us at `support@srcf.net` so that we can
    better support you. Rememeber that the quality of Timeout is in part
    dependent on its users and whether they respect others using it.
-   Do not misuse our systems. Any attempt to backdoor, tamper with, or
    access unauthorized information will be swiftly dealt with and
    reported to the relevant authorities.
-   You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account. As
    is stated in our general ToS, we are not responsible for any
    attempts to access your account, including all possible events
    occurring following said access.
-   Use of Timeout for purposes not directly related to the University
    is allowed and encouraged as we understand the value of keeping in
    touch with friends and family during these trying times. Societies
    are more than welcome to use it to host their meetings and events.

Privacy policy
--------------

The following privacy applies when using Timeout and all of its related
services.

Note
:::

Many of the items listed below are a consequence of the technical set-up
of BBB, which would take a significant amount of effort and time to
modify. For more technical information, please [visit this
link](https://github.com/ichdasich/bbb-privacy). Note that we may make
changes to our platform that would make statements in the above link
invalid.
:::

### Introduction and contact

This service is run by the Student-Run Computing Facility (referred to
henceforth as \"the SRCF\", \"the Society\", \"we\", \"our\" or \"us\").

The latest version of this statement can be found on our website at
<https://docs.srcf.net/timeout/tos.html>. The SRCF is the data
controller for data held under this privacy statement. The SRCF
Executive is the designated data protection contact, and are in charge
of data protection matters. They can be contacted at
`data-protection@srcf.net`.

Please note: this statement only applies to data held by the SRCF for
which it is the data controller. Timeout also processes data for which
the SRCF is not the data controller, for example any content within a
meeting provided by its participants. You should refer to the privacy
statement of the controller of that data where this applies to you as a
data subject.

### Definitions

\"Personal data\" or \"personal information\" means information relating
to you that can be used in some way to identify you, either on its own
or in combination with other such information available to its holder.

\"Processing\" of personal data is any action taken on that data, such
as storage, retrieval, organisation, transmission or erasure, and/or as
defined by relevant legislation.

\"University\" means the University of Cambridge.

A \"CRSid\" is a unique identifier issued to a person by the University.
According to the University, CRSids are never reissued, so we assume
that a CRSid will uniquely identify the same person forever. Usernames
on our computer systems are also assigned to match a person\'s CRSid.

### The bases on which we process personal data

Timeout usually processes members\' personal data on the basis that it
is a legitimate interest of the service. Where we process your personal
information for a purpose falling outside those listed in this statement
or our other privacy statements (if applicable to you), we will seek
your explicit consent before doing so.

### How users\' personal data is used by Timeout

Timeout collects and processes its users\' personal data for a number of
purposes, namely:

-   Maintaining a list of users and associate rooms and recordings to
    the user;
-   Keeping system logs to identify issues and investigate security
    incidents;
-   Functional session cookies to remember your login across different
    pages;
-   Your name and CRSid to identify you in meetings;
-   Maintaining aggregate server statistics to monitor the utilization,
    performance, and availability of our servers. Personally
    identifiable information used during the computation of aggregate
    statistics is not stored.

All of the above activities are carried out as a legitimate interest of
the Society.

We also collect video and audio data during meetings to share with other
participants, which is necessary for delivering the service. For
sessions where the host did not configure recordings, all data related
to the session is deleted shortly after it ends. See the
[Recordings\<Recordings\>]{role="ref"} section for details on how
recordings are processed.

Please get in touch with the designated data protection contact if you
have concerns or queries about any of these stated purposes.

### How we obtain and share your personal data

We primarily obtain your personal data through publicly accessible
information via the University Lookup. The initial signup process
involves automatic retrieval of your name from [the University Lookup
Directory](https://help.uis.cam.ac.uk/service/collaboration/lookup)
based on your CRSid, which itself is obtained from the University\'s
Raven service used to authenticate. You details are tied to the Lookup
directory, so if you wish to change your name you are free to do so by
editing your name on your Lookup page.

Your name and CRSid can be viewed by all users.

We share some of your personal data outside out Timeout in the following
cases:

-   We may share relevant personal data with CamCERT in some situations,
    for example:
    -   whilst investigating security incidents on Timeout where CamCERT
        may be able to help;
    -   where CamCERT has a legitimate interest in the data for a
        University-wide response to a security incident;
    -   to report abuse of computing facilities on the University data
        network.
-   The SRCF may otherwise be required to share (with or without your
    consent) your personal data with the University, or become subject
    to a legal requirement to share it with a third party. Where
    possible in either situation, we will notify you in advance of our
    intention to do so, but this may sometimes be prohibited, for
    example by law or an injunction.

All servers used in our service are located in Cambridge, UK.

### Your rights

You have the right to ask for:

-   access to your personal information;
-   the correction of any errors in your personal information;
-   the erasure of your personal information;
-   restriction on processing of your personal information pending
    correction or erasure; and
-   the transfer of your personal information to a third party by
    electronic means.

Some of these rights are not automatic, and we reserve the right to
discuss with you why we might not comply with a request from you to
exercise them.

If you have any questions or concerns about your personal information,
please get in touch with the designated data protection contact listed
at the top of this document. Please note that in dealing with your
request, we may also need to share details of your request with entities
with whom we have shared your personal data.

If you remain unhappy with the way your information is being handled, or
with the response received from us, you have the right to lodge a
complaint with the Information Commissioner\'s Office at Wycliffe House,
Water Lane, Wilmslow, SK9 5AF or online at <https://ico.org.uk/>.

### Recordings {#Recordings}

When a room is created, the host can choose to recording the room. We
consider the host of the room to be the data controller, and the SRCF
acts as the data processor. The information presented below is for
informational purposes only and is not part of Timeout\'s privacy
policy.

When a room is created that allows recordings (i.e. the recording button
is present), BBB will always record the entirety of the session
*independently of whether the button is actually pressed*. After a
meeting ends, the raw files are processed and cut according to the
markers you set when you press stop/start recording. For technical
reasons, the raw files are retained indefinitely after the meeting. This
policy is likely to change in the future as technology evolves.

By default, recordings are not publicly accessible. The room\'s hosts
may make the recording public and share with others directly via our
platform or as downloaded files. If a recording is made public via our
platform, anyone with the url can access the recording.

Note that the url of the recording is obtained by combining the meeting
id with the time the recording was made. Thus, a determined meeting
participant may be able to find the recordings of other meetings held in
the same room. If this is a concern, you should use a different from for
each set of participants.

In case you are trying to join a session that is being recorded, we will
inform you about this before you join the session and request your
consent to the recording. Since we cannot selectively record only
contributions from participants that consented to being recorded, in
case you do not consent, it is sadly not possible to join such a
session.
