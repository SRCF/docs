## Overview

Static site generators allow you to leverage powerful markup formats and consistent styling to produce websites that load *really quickly*. In fact, these docs are an example!

## Introduction

There are two types of content that can be served via a web server: dynamic and static. Some websites need to be dynamic by nature, like online banking, but others, that mostly deliver information via text, don't. Using a web application or full-fledged content management system to do the latter can seriously slow down load times for your website.

Writing raw HTML is tricky and cumbersome, however, so so-called static site generators have emerged as powerful tools to turn simple markup into pretty websites.

There are also other noteworthy benefits, so [give this a read](https://gohugo.io/about/benefits/).

A few reputable SSGs out there include:

* Hugo
* Jekyll
* Gatsby

Static site generators don't preclude you from having dynamic *content*. Gatsby, powered by React, is an example that has good integrations (HTTP requests, GraphQL) so you can easily make such queries and insert new content into your pages.
