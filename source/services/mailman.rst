Mailing lists
-------------

We run `Mailman mailing lists <https://lists.srcf.net>`__ for both personal and group accounts.  New lists can be created via the control panel.

The default list administrator for personal accounts is ``<crsid>@srcf.net``. Fr group accounts the default list administrator is the group account's admin address ``<groupname>-admins@srcf.net``.  To avoid complicating group account handovers, we recommend you keep this default for group-owned lists, and manage list admins by adding to the group account admin list.  You are free to use the list moderator role to add additional users for approving postings and subscriptions.

To delete a mailing list, you'll need to `contact the sysadmins <https://www.srcf.net/contact>`__.  Unless asked otherwise, we will retain the list archives (though the archives must be public for them to remain accessible).
