Usenet (NNTP)
-------------

Connecting
~~~~~~~~~~

The SRCF offers a Usenet server for our users. To connect, you will
need to point your newsreader at ``news.srcf.net`` and connect using a
secure connection (SSL) to port 563. In order to combat spam, you will
need to login with your SRCF username and password.

If you wish to use Alpine as your newsreader then you will find that our
shell server ``pip`` has a default configuration ready to go. Otherwise
you will need to configure it by going to (S)etup, (C)onfig and then
setting nntp-server to ``news.srcf.net/ssl/user=pqrs2`` where ``pqrs2``
is your CRSid.
