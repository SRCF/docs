Getting help
------------

Should you at any point need help, we offer three different solutions:

1. this growing collection of documentation
2. `a live chat support service <https://webchat.srcf.net/?channels=support>`__
3. email: ``support@srcf.net``

**Please do not be afraid to ask for help!** Asking for help is an essential stage of the learning process. In the first instance, check the common requests below and see if that helps you. If not, or if you don't know where to start or what to look for, hop in our live support channel and we'll help get you sorted.

.. important::
   The SRCF is run by volunteers who help to maintain its services for hundreds of societies. Our services are free and therefore we rely on donations. If you can, please `consider donating <https://www.srcf.net/donate>`__.

Learning
--------

The SRCF is run by a community of volunteers, all of which are constantly learning new things as we improve and grow the SRCF. Being a newcomer to many of the things in this documentation shouldn't stop you from using our systems or one day joining us. We've produced a series of tutorials and gathered recommended links for you below. **These are highly recommended if you're just getting started with the SRCF or Linux.**
