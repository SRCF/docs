Getting started
---------------

To start with, you'll need to `create a personal account <https://control.srcf.net/signup>`__.  This will allow you to use the control panel to add more services.

Personal vs. group account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All SRCF users, whether they are looking for web hosting for themselves, or wish to
administrate a group account, must first get a personal SRCF account. It is completely
fine if you apply for SRCF membership when all you really want is to run the
website of a society (or other group), rather than your own.
